      Abstract. As Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation over
      encrypted data, it is a natural question of how efficiently it handles standard integer
      computations like 64-bit arithmetic. It has long been believed that the CGGI/DM
      family or the BGV/BFV family are the best options, depending on the size of the
      parallelism. The discrete variant of CKKS, suggested by Drucker et al. [J.Cryptol.’24],
      provides an interesting alternative for integer computations. Notably, the modular
      reduction framework proposed by Kim and Noh [CiC’25] built on top of the CKKS-
      style functional bootstrapping by Bae et al. [Asiacrypt’24] gives an efficient arithmetic
      modulo small integers.
      In this work, we propose a novel homomorphic computer for unsigned integer compu-
      tations. We represent a large integer (e.g. 64-bit) as a vector of smaller chunks (e.g.
      4-bit) and construct arithmetic operations relying on discrete CKKS. The proposed
      scheme supports many of the operations supported in TFHE-rs while outperforming it
      in terms of amortized running time. Notably, our homomorphic 64-bit multiplication
      takes 8.85ms per slot, which is more than three orders of magnitude faster than
      TFHE-rs.

1    Introduction
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a branch of cryptography that allows computation
in an encrypted state. Since Gentry’s first instantiation [Gen09], the efficiency of FHE has
been improved dramatically. The major FHE schemes can be categorized into LWE-based
and RLWE-based depending on whether the default ciphertext format is LWE or RLWE,
respectively. LWE-based schemes such as the CGGI/DM family [CGGI16, DM15] are
known to be fast (in terms of latency) and flexible, while RLWE-based schemes such as the
BGV/BFV family [Bra12, FV12, BGV12] and CKKS [CKKS17] have better throughput.
One of the key technical differences is that computations on LWE-based schemes mostly
rely on programmable/functional bootstrapping [CJP21, KS23] whereas computations on
RLWE-based schemes mainly use homomorphic polynomial evaluations (i.e. addition and
multiplication).
    It had long been believed that different families are good at different functionalities. For
instance, the CGGI/DM family was used to handle small or non-parallelizable computations,
the BGV/BFV family was used to handle parallelizable large integer computations, and
CKKS was used to handle real number arithmetic. However, recent improvements in
the discrete variant of CKKS [DMPS24, CKKL24, BCKS24, BKSS24, AKP25, KN25]
suggest that this may not be true. In particular, recent works [BCKS24, BKSS24, AKP25]
show that CKKS handles functional/programmable bootstrapping more efficiently than
CGGI/DM by several orders of magnitude. As functional/programmable bootstrapping is

a core component of CGGI/DM, this means that it can be preferable to use CKKS if we
have sufficient parallelism.
    Since we know that CKKS handles homomorphic look-up tables efficiently, a natural
question is whether CKKS is good at integer computations in general. For computations
modulo NTT-friendly primes, it seems that the BGV/BFV family is the right choice, as
they provide a fast and efficient solution for both latency and throughput, in light of
recent improvements in BGV/BFV bootstrapping [MHWW24, KSS24] and generalization
of BFV [GV25, CHM+ 25]. However, when it comes to standard modulo power-of-two
computations like unsigned 64-bit arithmetic, the landscape is relatively unclear. The
most straightforward option, to use the plaintext modulus to be a power-of-two has several
problems. One problem is that the plaintext modulus is too large to be efficiently supported.
For instance, 64-bit multiplications in BGV/BFV enlarge the noise by more than 64 bits,
and choosing large parameters like large ring degree (e.g. log(N ) ≥ 17) is unavoidable.1
Recall that large parameters lead to inefficiency in terms of latency and memory footprint,
which is not desirable. Another problem is that the use of a power-of-two modulus prevents
one from using large parallelism. In BGV/BFV, the number of slots is determined by
how the cyclotomic polynomial ΦM (X) splits in the plaintext space Zt . As t is a power-
of-two, we do not have as many slots as in the case of NTT-friendly primes, leading to
lower throughput for handling modulo t computations in parallel.2 In addition, directly
using computations over Zt makes it difficult to handle important components of integer
arithmetic such as bit shift and comparison.
    Instead of directly supporting Zt arithmetic for large t, the existing approaches
often decompose t into several chunks to improve efficiency. For instance, several
works [CKK16, XCWF16, QZL+ 19, ZQH+ 21, HZY+ 22] considered radix-2 arithmetic
operations for handling integer computations. Similarly, [TLW+ 21, IZ21] decompose large
modulus into smaller finite field elements, leading to efficient homomorphic comparison.
By decomposing the desired plaintext modulus t, one can keep the noise growth small while
supporting efficient homomorphic operations like comparison and bit shifts. However, as
modulo 2 (or 2ℓ for small ℓ) plaintext space still has a limited number of slots, the SIMD
capability or throughput is not as great as the case of NTT-friendly plaintext modulus.
    An alternative option is to use the other families, such as CGGI/DM or CKKS. Using
CGGI/DM to handle integer computations is relatively well explored, and the major
libraries like TFHE-rs [Zam22] allow standard power-of-two modulus integer computations
by using lower precision arithmetic as a building block. On the other hand, using
CKKS to handle integer computations is new (motivated in [DMPS24] and improved
in [BCKS24, BKSS24, AKP25, KN25]) and has not yet been fully explored.3 For small
precision like 4 or 8 bits, one can regard integers as real numbers and rely on CKKS
operations, look-up tables [CKKL24], and modular reduction [KN25].4 For large precision,
a straightforward approach is to use high-precision CKKS and directly support Zt for
large power-of-two integer t, but this has similar problems as in BGV/BFV, such as large
parameters and lack of efficient comparison/bit shift.
    In this regard, it can be tempting to use a decomposition-based approach as in
   1 The standard BGV/BFV bootstrapping (e.g. [MHWW24, GIKV23]) is a polynomial evaluation over

a large modulus, leading to huge modulus consumption. For instance, the bootstrapping in [GIKV23] for
251 modulus consumes ≈ 1000 bits for digit removal. Instead, one could use the BFV bootstrapping from
CKKS [KSS24], but it needs many META-BTS [BCC+ 22] iterations.
   2 If M is odd, Φ (X) splits into ϕ(M )/ ord (2) irreducible factors, which corresponds to the number of
                   M                           M
slots [GV23, Section 2.3]. Hence there is at most ϕ(M )/ log2 (M ) slots (∵ ordM (2) ≥ log2 (M )). Concretely,
[GIKV23] uses M = 42799 and φ(42799)/21 = 2016 slots. For a similar ring dimension φ(M ) = 32768,
CKKS has φ(M ) = 32768 real slots, which is more than an order of magnitude more.
   3 For SIMD functional bootstrapping, one may consider other approaches (e.g. [MS18, LW23, PMH+ 25]),

but we consider the CKKS-based approach for efficiency.
   4 A concurrent work [NHY+ 25] focuses on avoiding XOR operations by relying on RLWE modular

reduction (as in [KN25]).

BGV/BFV. Indeed, [ZYZ+ 24] suggests using decomposition to efficiently handle both
homomorphic multiplication and comparison. However, their arithmetic operations do
not modular reduce, and individual digits exceed the base and continuously grow. As
a result, their approach cannot support bootstrapping and can evaluate only circuits of
predetermined size. To support bootstrapping, we need to take care of the carries every
time we perform homomorphic arithmetic operations. Since CKKS does not naturally
support modular reduction, we need a different strategy than the ones in the BGV/BFV
family. In this paper, we suggest using the modular reduction in [KN25] to efficiently
instantiate fully homomorphic encryption over large unsigned integers (i.e. arithmetic over
Z2k for large k).

1.1    Technical Overview
We provide a simplified overview of our method, focusing on how the underlying message
behaves through homomorphic operations. At a high level, we decompose a large integer
into digits and rely on the textbook addition/multiplication of a convolution form that
computes iteratively from the lowest digit. Let d be the base for our digit decomposition,
and let t = du be the target modulus. Our goal is to enable Zt arithmetic using digit
decomposition of base d.

Ingredients
We rely on a homomorphic computing system that supports addition and multiplication
over Z (up to a moderate precision) and modular reduction [·]d for some d ∈ Z>0 .5 Such a
homomorphic computer can be instantiated via the discrete variant of CKKS (based on
[DMPS24, KN25]), which we discuss in detail in Section 2. The computing system has a
particular efficiency property that modular reduction is much more costly than addition
and multiplication. Due to this property, we need arithmetic algorithms that minimize the
number of modular reductions.

Reduction
    Pu−1
Let i=0 ai · di be a representation of a modulo Zdu integer, where each ai could possibly
be greater than or equal to d. The reduction operation converts it to a reduced form so
that all the digits belong to {0, 1, . . . , d − 1} as in the standard representation. To minimize
the number of modular reductions, we can iteratively compute the ith digit starting from
the least significant digit. To be precise, the iterations work as follows.
   • At step 0, we divide a0 by d and get quotient and remainder q0 and r0 , respectively.
     We then set c1 := q0 + a1 .
   • At step 1 ≤ i < u − 1, we divide ci by d and get quotient and remainder qi and ri ,
     respectively. We then set ci+1 = qi + ai+1 .
                                                           Pu−1
   • At step u − 1, we compute ru−1 = [cu−1 ]d and output i=0 ri · di .
This leads to u modular reductions in total.

Difficulty
Although the definition of reduction is straightforward, there is a hidden obstacle in the
construction. That is, division by d consumes ciphertext modulus at least by d, leading
to a continuous decline in modulus. In particular, the modulus of ci is at least di times
smaller than that of a0 , significantly increasing the overall FHE parameters. To tackle this
  5 The choice of d affects the performance of the modular reduction. A typical choice is 4-8 bits.

problem, we bootstrap some of the ci ’s using iterative discrete bootstrapping from [KN25].
The number of bootstrapping iterations to bootstrap ci depends on the size of ci : we may
use β discrete bootstrappings for ci ≤ dβ . It is important to keep the size of each ai small
during homomorphic operations so that each ci becomes small.

Multiplication
We describe our multiplication algorithm,
                                    Pu−1     which canPbe written as a combination of
                                                           u−1
convolution and reduction. Let a = i=0 ai ·di and b = i=0 bi ·di be digit decompositions
of two integers a, b ∈ Zdu . We observe that
                                                      
                                       u−1
                                       X X   i
                              [ab]du =        aj bi−j  · di .
                                           i=0    j=0


Hence, to minimize the number
                           P of modular       reductions, we first compute a possibly
                              i
overflowing representation    j=0 aj bi−j         and reduce it afterwards. To count the
                                            0≤i<d
                                                                        Pi
number of bootstrappings needed in total, we measure the size of each j=0 aj bi−j . We
                     Pi
choose u ≤ d so that j=0 aj bi−j ≤ u · d2 ≤ d3 , resulting in ≈ 3u bootstrappings.6

Other Operations
Our idea naturally extends to other operations, including addition, subtraction, comparison,
and bit shift. Addition and subtraction work similarly to multiplication: we first perform
digit-wise addition/subtraction and reduce afterward. Interestingly, a homomorphic
comparison a ≥ b between two u-digit integers a and b can be interpreted as a special case
of subtraction, as we can first compute a − b as u + 1-digit subtraction and extract the
highest digit. If the highest digit is 0, then it means that a ≥ b, and otherwise the highest
digit is −1. For a homomorphic shift operation by a scalar, we shift the digits and apply
modular reductions. For instance, if we left shift by y < log2 (d), then the ith digit can be
written as
                                lo(ai << y) + hi(ai−1 << y)
where (a0 , a1 , . . . , au−1 ) is the input and lo and hi refers to remainder and quotient modulo
d, respectively.
    As a result, our homomorphic computer is equipped with frequently used unsigned inte-
ger operations with reasonable performance, serving as a perfect baseline for implementing
any applications based on integer operations.

1.2    Contribution
We propose an efficient Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) FHE over integers that
supports a wide range of operations. In particular, our scheme provides three different
types of operations, namely arithmetic operations, comparison, and bootstrapping. Note
that these operations are the most important primitives of FHE and are necessary for
most applications.

Concrete Efficiency
Among the schemes that support diverse operations, our scheme provides the best through-
put. As we rely on CKKS, we enjoy almost the maximum parallelism possible (i.e. N/2
   6 O(u2 ) homomorphic multiplications are negligible compared to the O(u) modular reductions as long

as u is not too large.

slots), outperforming the approaches based on other FHE schemes. We compare the
concrete performance on homomorphic multiplication and comparison in Table 1 and 2.
Compared to the widely used TFHE-rs [Zam22], our multiplication and comparison are
roughly three and two orders of magnitude faster, respectively. When compared with radix-
based approaches using BGV/BFV, our multiplication and comparison are approximately
two and one orders of magnitude faster, respectively.

    Compared to the possible approaches that directly encode large integers without
decomposition, our method achieves much smaller FHE parameters. As arithmetic over
Zt for large t like 64-bit consumes a huge amount of modulus per multiplication, it
is unavoidable for the direct encoding approaches to use large ring dimension such as
log N = 17, 18. On the other hand, we use an FHE parameter for Zd to instantiate
modulo at most dd arithmetic, having significantly smaller parameters to achieve the same
precision. Indeed, we were able to instantiate 64-bit precision arithmetic using log N = 15
parameters with only ≈ 800 bits of modulus budget.

Versatility
Our scheme is not only efficient but also offers a variety of operations. Traditionally, SIMD
schemes were only capable of computing addition and multiplication, leading to inefficiency
in computing other types of functions. On the contrary, our scheme supports arithmetic,
comparison, and shift operations, leading to a wider set of instructions to emulate the
(unencrypted) computer. Furthermore, our scheme is compatible with the multi-precision
arbitrary function evaluation in [AKP25], supporting any functions over unsigned integers.
In addition, our method gives CKKS the ability to efficiently compute over large integers,
which means that the capability of CKKS is extended to both real numbers and integers.
As our encoding is directly compatible with the CKKS encoding, one can efficiently convert
from our encoding to CKKS and vice versa, to maximize efficiency.

Enhanced Security
As the original CKKS cannot distinguish the error from the message, it was difficult
for CKKS to achieve advanced security notions such as IND-CPAD security [LM21] or
Threshold FHE security [AJL+ 12, BGG+ 18]. Since the discrete CKKS framework allows
us to distinguish the error from the ciphertext by discretizing the message space, it can

enjoy the advantages of the exact schemes in terms of security. As we provide an efficient
integer computer, discrete CKKS supports any operation without going through the
original CKKS, leading to better security. For instance, one may use our homomorphic
fixed point arithmetic instead of the usual CKKS operations to avoid large noise flooding
needed to achieve advanced security.

2.1    CKKS Basics
In CKKS, there are two kinds of encoding called slots-encoding and coeffs-encoding. The
slots-encoding Ecd : CN/2 → R is defined as
                                     Ecd(⃗z) = ⌊∆ · iDFT(⃗z)⌉
where ∆ > 0 is a scaling factor. The slots-decoding Dcd : R → CN/2 is defined as

The slots-encoding supports SIMD computations and is used as a default encoding for
CKKS. The coeffs-encoding CoeffEcd : RN → R is defined as

As coeffs-encoding is compatible with coefficient-wise operations, we use it for boot-
strapping (to raise modulus), conversions to/from other schemes [BGGJ20], or modular
reduction [KN25].
    In CKKS, each homomorphic multiplication increases the scaling factor from ∆ to ∆2 ,
and we rescale the ciphertext to keep the scaling factor to be ≃ ∆. As rescaling reduces
the ciphertext modulus, the ciphertext modulus gradually decreases and cannot allow
further multiplications at some point. The CKKS bootstrapping [CHK+ 18] increases
the modulus, recovering the multiplicative capability.
Definition 1 (CKKS Bootstrapping). Let q, Q > 1 be integers such that Q > q. Let
ct ∈ R2q be a CKKS ciphertext encrypting a vector ⃗z ∈ CN/2 via the slots-encoding, where
both real and imaginary parts of each entry are in [−1, 1]. The CKKS bootstrapping
BTS : R2q → R2Q raises the modulus while approximately preserving the underlying message.
That is,
                                  BTS(ct) = ct′ ∈ R2Q
where Dcd ◦ Dec(ct) ≃ Dcd ◦ Dec(ct′ ). Here Dec denotes the CKKS decryption, i.e., taking
an inner product with a secret key sk = (1, s) ∈ R2 .

    The standard CKKS bootstrapping [CHK+ 18] can be simplified as a combination of
modulus raising (denoted as ModRaise) and modular reduction (denoted as EvalMod). If
one embeds a CKKS ciphertext ct ∈ R2q0 at the lowest modulus q0 into a larger modulus Q,
a small integral error term I is added, and the underlying plaintext polynomial m becomes
m + q0 · I. The EvalMod procedure homomorphically evaluates a modular reduction to
remove q0 · I.
    An additional issue is that ModRaise and EvalMod are compatible with different encod-
ing structures, coeffs-encoding and slots-encoding, respectively. Hence, we need to convert
slots encoding to coeffs encoding and vice versa, denoted as StC and CtS, respectively.
As a result, the CKKS bootstrapping is instantiated with the order of StC-ModRaise-CtS-
EvalMod, as illustrated in Algorithm 1.

 Algorithm 1: Slot Bootstrapping [BCC+ 22]
   Setting : ∆ ≪ q0 .
   Input : ct = Enc ◦ Ecd(⃗z) ∈ R2q with ⃗z ∈ [−1, 1]N/2 .
   Output : ctout ∈ R2Q = Enc ◦ Ecd(w),
                                    ⃗ where w   ⃗ ≃ ⃗z.
 1 ctout ← EvalMod ◦ CtS ◦ ModRaise ◦ StC(ct);
 2 return ctout .




2.2    Discrete CKKS
The recent improvements in the discrete variant of CKKS (first formalized in [DMPS24])
use a subspace of C to handle discrete data. For instance, one may restrict the message
space to Z ⊂ C. We observe that the inclusion Z ,→ C is a ring homomorphism, and
addition and multiplication over integers are directly inherited from CKKS. Importantly,
this framework allows us to distinguish the underlying error from the ciphertext, which
was not possible in the original CKKS.
 Definition 2 (Discrete CKKS Ciphertext). Let U ⊆ C be a finite set. A discrete
 CKKS ciphertext encrypting a vector ⃗z ∈ U N/2 is a CKKS ciphertext ct that decrypts to
⃗z + ⃗e ∈ CN/2 where ⃗e is small. In this case, we call ⃗z and ⃗e as the underlying message and
 error of the discrete CKKS ciphertext ct, respectively.
    As the error can be identified, we may reduce the error by evaluating a cleaning
polynomial. For instance, [DMPS24] describes a cleaning function h1 (x) = 3x2 − 2x3 for
the encoding set U = {0, 1} ⊂ C. The function h1 satisfies h1 (0) = 0 and h1 (1) = 1, and
has vanishing derivatives on {0, 1}, thereby sending points close to 0 and 1 closer to 0 and
1, respectively.
Definition 3 (Cleaning). Let U ⊆ C be a finite set. Let ct ∈ R2q be a discrete CKKS
ciphertext encrypting a vector ⃗z ∈ U N/2 whose underlying error is ⃗e ∈ CN/2 . The cleaning
function maps ct to ct′ , so that the underlying error of ct′ , denoted as ⃗e′ is much smaller
than ⃗e.
    Discrete CKKS can efficiently handle two types of operations, namely arithmetic
operations and interpolation. Arithmetic operation refers to addition and multiplication
over Z inherited from CKKS, whereas interpolation refers to polynomial interpolations over
a finite number of points on the complex plane. For interpolation, [CKKL24] suggests using
complex roots-of-unity for polynomial interpolations, as it provides more numerically stable
interpolation than the typical equispaced points on the real line (e.g. {0, 1, . . . , d − 1} ⊆ C).
The power of interpolation is that one can evaluate an arbitrary function : Zd → C for some
small integer d. Note that the original CKKS needs to rely on polynomial approximations
and thus could not compute discontinuous functions efficiently.

Definition 4 (Interpolation over roots-of-unity). Let Ud = {1, ω, . . . , ω d−1 } ⊆ C where
ω is a primitive d-th root of unity. Let f : Zd → C be an arbitrary function. The
homomorphic look-up table LUTf : R2Q → R2Q homomorphically evaluates an interpolation
that corresponds to f . That is, ω α ∈ Ud is mapped to f (α) for each slot.

    [BCKS24, BKSS24, AKP25] build an analogue of functional/programmable bootstrap-
ping in CGGI/DM [CJP21, KS23] for discrete CKKS. In other words, they design new
bootstrapping circuits dedicated to discrete data that evaluate an arbitrary function
during bootstrapping. Notably, the CKKS-style functional bootstrapping (i.e. discrete
bootstrapping) can be regarded as a parallelization of CGGI/DM bootstrapping which is
several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art such as [Zam22]. We provide a
(simplified) instantiation of discrete bootstrapping from [BKSS24] in Algorithm 2. Here
EvalExp denotes a homomorphic evaluation of the complex exponential function x 7→ e2πix .

    Algorithm 2: Discrete Bootstrapping [BKSS24]
      Setting : U = {0, 1, . . . , d − 1} ⊂ C.
      Input : ct ∈ R2Q a discrete CKKS ciphertext encrypting ⃗z ∈ U N/2 . f : Zd → C
                an arbitrary function.
      Output : ctout encrypting f (⃗z).
    1 ctout ← LUTf ◦ EvalExp ◦ CtS ◦ ModRaise ◦ StC(ct);
    2 return ctout .



   More recently, [KN25] suggested using discrete bootstrapping to instantiate homo-
morphic modular reduction. Recall that the original CKKS does not have an inherent
modular reduction, unlike other schemes like BGV/BFV. The main reason is that CKKS
encodes messages in the least significant bits via DFT, which is not compatible with
modular reduction. However, [KN25] observed that we can indeed use the native modular
reduction at the bottom modulus by incorporating discrete bootstrapping as a subroutine.
For instance, simply choosing f as an identity function and inserting an RLWE modular
reduction between ModRaise and StC gives a modular reduction by a smaller integer d
denoted as IntModd . See Algorithm 3 for details.

    Algorithm 3: IntModd [KN25]
      Setting : id : Zd → Zd an identity map, and ∆0 = q0 /d.
      Input : ct ∈ R2Q a discrete CKKS ciphertext encrypting ⃗z ∈ ZN/2 .
      Output : ctout encrypting [⃗z]d .
    1 ctout ← LUTid ◦ EvalExp ◦ CtS ◦ ModRaise ◦ [StC(ct)]q0 ;
    2 return ctout .



    As a summary of the previous works, we provide a simplified overview of discrete
CKKS in Figure 1. In discrete CKKS, there are three separated ciphertext formats
providing different operations. Here, separated means that one can only perform one type
of operation in a single format and needs to evaluate some (expensive) transformations
to convert it to the other formats. To be specific, three formats can be denoted as
arithmetic, coefficient, and interpolation formats. First, the arithmetic format refers to
the usual CKKS slots-encoding, which supports addition and multiplication inherited
from the original CKKS. In terms of discrete computations, one can use this type for
integer additions and multiplications. Second, the coefficients format refers to the coeffs-
encoded CKKS ciphertext at the bottom modulus. This type of ciphertexts are used
to perform RLWE modular reduction as suggested in [KN25] or conversions between
RLWE/MLWE/LWE (one may refer to [BCK+ 23]). Third, the interpolation format refers

to discrete CKKS ciphertexts encoded via roots-of-unity encoding as in [CKKL24], suitable
for handling polynomial interpolations. It would usually be integrated with bootstrapping
as in [BKSS24, AKP25], but one can specifically use this kind of encoding to handle
arbitrary functions more efficiently. The arith-to-coeff, coeff-to-interpolate, interpolate-
to-arith conversions can be instantiated with StC, EvalExp ◦ CtS ◦ ModRaise, and LUTf ,
respectively.


3     Proposed Method
In this section, we design a homomorphic computer that supports standard unsigned
integer computations (e.g. 64-bit arithmetic), on top of the discrete CKKS framework
introuced in the previous section. Let t = 2k be the target modulus for which we want to
evaluate. As a high-level overview, we decompose t via a digit decomposition by a smaller
modulus d = 2ℓ and handle modulo t computation using several modulo d computations.
For instance, we may choose k = 64 and ℓ = 4, leading to evaluating 64-bit computation
using k/ℓ = 16 digits of modulo 2ℓ = 16 computations.

3.1     Scheme Description
We first illustrate how we put k-bit data into discrete CKKS ciphertexts. The message in
                                                                               N/2
our encoding is a vector of k-bit integers ⃗z = (z0 , z1 , . . . , zN/2−1 ) ∈ Zt . To encrypt this
vector, we use u = k/ℓ ciphertexts ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ctu−1 where cti encrypts the ith digit of
the base-d representation of ⃗z. That is,
                             cti = Enc ◦ Ecd(z0i , z1i , . . . , z(N/2−1)i )
where zj = zj(u−1) zj(u−2) · · · zj0 (d) for each 0 ≤ j < N/2. Here, each ciphertext cti for
0 ≤ i < u is a valid discrete CKKS ciphertext for Zd computations. Therefore, we may use
any operations in the prior works of discrete CKKS, such as arithmetic operations, table
look-ups, and modular reduction. In particular, we mainly rely on addition, multiplication,
and modular reduction to handle ring operations over Zd as well as the carry operation.
To keep the discrete bootstrapping for Zd efficient, we choose d to be sufficiently small
(e.g. d ≤ 28 ). In terms of cleaning, we may use digit-wise cleaning for Zd (e.g. cleaning for
d-th roots of unity as in [CKKL24]). We elaborate on the encryption scheme as follows.
                                                                N/2
    • Encryption: Let ⃗z = (z0 , z1 , . . . , zN/2−1 ) ∈ Zt           be a vector of k-bit unsigned
                                          N/2
       integers. The encryption IntEnc : Zt → (R2Q )u is defined as

                       IntEnc(⃗z) = Enc ◦ Ecd(z0i , z1i , . . . , z(N/2−1)i ) 0≤i<u
                                                                             

       where zj = zj(u−1) zj(u−2) · · · zj0 (d) is the base d representation of zj for each
       0 ≤ j < N/2.

     • Decryption: Let ct = (ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ctu−1 ) be a vector of discrete CKKS ciphertexts.
                                                 N/2
       The decryption IntDec : (R2Q )u → Zt          is defined as

                                      IntDec(ct) =                  ⌊Dcd ◦ Dec(cti )⌉ · di .
                                                            i=0


     • Bootstrapping: Given a ciphertext ct = (ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ctu−1 ) encrypting a vector
             N/2
       ⃗z ∈ Zt , the bootstrapping Boot : (R2q )u → (R2Q )u is defined as

                                         Boot(ct) = (IntBootd (cti ))0≤i<u

        where IntBootd : R2q → R2Q refers to an identity discrete bootstrapping (i.e. functional
        bootstrapping evaluating an identity function) for Zd . For simplicity, we assume
        that this bootstrapping not only raises the modulus but also reduces the noise. See
        [BKSS24, AKP25] for details.

Theorem 1 (Encryption Correctness). Let ⃗z = (z0 , z1 , . . . , zN/2−1 ) ∈ Zut be a vector of
k-bit unsigned integers. Then we have

                                           IntDec ◦ IntEnc(⃗z) = ⃗z.
                         Pu−1
Proof. Observe that zj =    i=0 zji · d from the base-d representation of zj . By the
                                       i

correctness of CKKS encryption and decryption, we have

                                         u−1
                                         X

                                          i=0                   0≤j<N/2




Theorem 2 (Bootstrapping Correctness). Let ct ∈ (Rq )u be a ciphertext encrypting a
             N/2
vector ⃗z ∈ Zt   according to the above encryption. Then we have

                                           IntDec ◦ Boot(ct) = ⃗z.

Proof. Let ct = (ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ctu−1 ) and ⃗z = (z0 , z1 , . . . , zN/2−1 ). Let zj = zj(u−1) zj(u−2) · · · zj0
(d) be the base-d representation of zj for each 0 ≤ j < N/2. Let w              ⃗ i = (z0i , z1i , . . . , z(N/2−1)i ) ∈
  N/2
Zd be a vector of ℓ-bit unsigned integers for each 0 ≤ i < u. Then by the definition
of the encryption, we have that cti is a valid discrete CKKS encryption of w⃗ i for each i.
Recall that the bootstrapping for ct is defined as an element-wise integer bootstrapping,
which means that the components of Boot(ct) are the bootstrappings of cti . Therefore, we
have
                               u−1
                               X                                                 u−1
                                                                                 X
      IntDec ◦ Boot(ct) =            ⌊Dcd ◦ Dec ◦ Boot(cti )⌉ · di =                   ⌊Dcd ◦ Dec(cti )⌉ · di = ⃗z.
                               i=0                                               i=0


     The second equality follows from the correctness of IntBootd .

3.2    Arithmetic Operations
Based on the encryption scheme defined in the previous subsection, we describe how we
define homomorphic arithmetic operations over Zt . We not only provide simple addition
and multiplication but also some popular operations (e.g. comparison, bit shift) that are
defined over unsigned integers. Recall that IntModd is a homomorphic modular reduction
by Zd as defined in Algorithm 3 and Carryd = (id − IntModd )/d.7
   • Reduction: Let ct = (ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ctu−1 ) ∈ (R2Q )u be a vector of discrete CKKS
     ciphertexts encrypting vectors in ZN/2 . The modular reduction of ct is sequentially
     defined as
                              Reduce(ct) = (ct′0 , ct′1 , . . . , ct′u−1 )
      where ct′0 = IntModd (ct0 ), ct′′0 = Carryd (ct0 ), and
                      ct′i = IntModd (ct′′i−1 + cti ),     ct′′i = Carryd (ct′′i−1 + cti )
      for each 1 ≤ i < u. The result of Reduce encrypts a message
                                        u−1
                                        X
                                              ⌊Dcd ◦ Dec(cti )⌉ · di
                                        i=0

      modulo t, i.e., reducing the ciphertext ct to the correct base-d representation. Let
      Carry(ct) be defined as ct′′u−1 .
   • Addition: Let ct = (cti )0≤i<u , ct′ = (ct′i )0≤i<u ∈ (R2Q )u be vectors of ciphertexts
     each encrypting a k-bit unsigned integer according to the encryption scheme in
     Section 3.1. The addition of ct and ct′ is defined as
                               Add(ct, ct′ ) = Reduce((cti + ct′i )0≤i<u )
      where the addition on the right-hand side is the usual CKKS addition.
   • Subtraction: Let ct = (cti )0≤i<u , ct′ = (ct′i )0≤i<u ∈ (R2Q )u be vectors of ciphertexts
     each encrypting a k-bit unsigned integer according to the encryption scheme in
     Section 3.1. The subtraction of ct and ct′ is defined as
                               Sub(ct, ct′ ) = Reduce((cti − ct′i )0≤i<u )
      where subtraction on the right-hand side is the usual CKKS subtraction.
   • Multiplication: Let ct = (cti )0≤i<u , ct′ = (ct′i )0≤i<u ∈ (R2Q )u be vectors of
     ciphertexts each encrypting a k-bit unsigned integer according to the encryption
     scheme in Section 3.1. The multiplication of ct and ct′ is defined as
                                                                      
                                             Xi
                   Mult(ct, ct′ ) = Reduce     Mult(ctj , ct′i−j )    
                                                     j=0
                                                                                0≤i<u

      where Mult on the right-hand side refers to the usual CKKS multiplication.
   • Comparison: Let ct = (cti )0≤i<u , ct′ = (ct′i )0≤i<u ∈ (R2Q )u be vectors of cipher-

     • Left Shift: Let ct = (ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ctu−1 ) ∈ (R2Q )u be a vector of ciphertexts encrypt-
       ing a k-bit unsigned integer according to the encryption scheme in Section 3.1. Let
       0 ≤ m < k be an integer. The left shift of ct by m denoted as ct << m is defined as
                    ct << m = (IntModd (cti−x << y) + Carryd (cti−x−1 << y))0≤i<u
        where x = ⌊m/ℓ⌋, y = [m]ℓ , and cti = 0 for i < 0.
     • Right Shift: Let ct = (ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ctu−1 ) ∈ (R2Q )u be a vector of ciphertexts
       encrypting a k-bit unsigned integer according to the encryption scheme in Section 3.1.
       Let 0 ≤ m < k be an integer. The right shift of ct by m denoted as ct >> m is
       defined as
            ct >> m = (Carryd (cti+x << (ℓ − y)) + IntModd (cti+x+1 << (ℓ − y)))0≤i<u
        where x = ⌊m/ℓ⌋, y = [m]ℓ , and cti = 0 for i ≥ u.
Theorem 3 (Arithmetic Correctness). Reduction, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication,
Comparison, Right Shift, and Left Shift, defined above, are correct.
Proof. We give proof for each operation.
     • Reduction: It suffices to show that
                            u−1
                            X                                     u−1
                                                                  X

        By mathematical induction, we first check that

        holds for each j. Again, we use mathematical induction and get
                       j
                                                  " j                        #

                         i=0                                  i=0                                dj+1
        for each j. By plugging in j = u − 1, we finish the proof.
     • Addition/Subtraction: We first check that
         u−1
         X                                         u−1

               ⌊Dcd ◦ Dec(cti ± ct′i )⌉ · di =           ⌊Dcd ◦ Dec(cti )⌉ · di ±             ⌊Dcd ◦ Dec(ct′i )⌉ · di
         i=0                                       i=0                                  i=0

        from the decryption correctness of (cti )i and (ct′i )i .
                                                               Then by the correctness of
        reduction, we have the correctness of addition/subtraction.
     • Multiplication: We first check that

   • Comparison: We observe that given an integer x, the corresponding carry operation
     computes (x − [x]t )/t. Let ct′ − ct encrypts an integer vector ⃗z ∈ ZN/2 according to
     the decryption function in Section 3.1. Since both ct and ct′ encrypt unsigned k-bit
     integers, we have −t < zi < t for each entry zi for ⃗z. In particular, the ith entry of
     ct is greater than or equal to the ith entry of ct′ if and only if zi ≥ 0. Note that
     the carry operation outputs 0 when 0 ≤ zi < t and outputs −1 when −t < zi < 0.
     Therefore, we have that Carry(ct − ct′ ) + 1 encrypts the right result.
   • Left shift: It suffices to check the base-d representation of the left shift of the original
     message. Let α = αu−1 αu−2 · · · α0 be the base-d representation of an unsigned k-bit
     integer α. Let β = βu−1 βu−2 · · · β0 be the base-d representation of α << m. For
     each i,                                         jα
                                                        i−x−1 << y
                                                                     k
                               βi = [αi−x << y]d +                     .
                                                            d
     This proves the correctness.
   • Right shift: It suffices to check the base-d representation of the right shift of the
     original message. Let α = αu−1 αu−2 · · · α0 be the base-d representation of an
     unsigned k-bit integer α. Let β = βu−1 βu−2 · · · β0 be the base-d representation of
     α >> m. For each i,
                                                      αi+x << (ℓ − y)
                                                                     
                      βi = [αi+x+1 << (ℓ − y)]d +                       .
                                                             d
      This proves the correctness.



3.3    Efficiency Analysis
We analyze the computational efficiency of each operation by counting the number of
discrete bootstrappings. Note that discrete bootstrapping is usually > 100 times more
costly than any other homomorphic operations (e.g. addition, multiplication), so it gives a
good approximation of the computational complexity.
Theorem 4 (Reduction Complexity). Let

                              ct = (ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ctu−1 ) ∈ (R2Q )u

be a vector of ciphertexts encrypting integer vectors in [0, dm − dm−1 ], where Q ≫ dm .
Then the number of discrete bootstrappings used to instantiate the Reduce operation is
≤ um − m + 1.
Proof. We provide an algorithm with at most um − m + 1 bootstrappings. Recall that
Reduce consists of u IntModd and u − 1 Carryd . The main issue is that the definition of
Carryd includes homomorphic division by d, which consumes modulus. To handle this
issue, we keep all the cti ’s, ct′i ’s, ct′′i ’s at the bootstrapping (output) level via discrete
bootstrapping. To do this, we instantiate Carryd with the iterative bootstrapping in [KN25].
The key observation is that ct′′i−1 + cti decrypts to an element < dm , which can be proved
by mathematical induction on i.
   • Base case i = 0: cti decrypts to ≤ dm − dm−1 < dm .
   • Assume i and prove i + 1: Assume that ct′′i−1 + cti decrypts to < dm . Then by the
     definition of Carryd , ct′′i decrypts to < dm−1 . Thus, ct′′i + cti+1 decrypts to

                                     < dm−1 + dm − dm−1 = dm .

     • By mathematical induction, we proved the desired property.
Therefore, Carryd can be instantiated with IntBootm−1 d     of [KN25, Algorithm 2] which
requires m − 1 discrete bootstrappings. As a result, we instantiate Reduce with u · 1 + (u −
1) · (m − 1) = um − m + 1 discrete bootstrappings.
Corollary 1 (Addition/Subtraction Complexity). The number of bootstrappings needed
for addition/subtraction is ≤ 2u − 1.
Proof. It follows directly from the fact that [0, d) + [0, d) = [0, 2d − 1) and [0, d) − [0, d) =
(−d, d) whose lengths are ≤ d2 − d.
Corollary 2 (Comparison Complexity). The number of bootstrappings needed for compar-
ison is ≤ 2u.
Proof. Recall that the comparison operation does exactly the same as the subtraction,
except for the last carry step. Hence, we need 2u − 1 + 1 = 2u discrete bootstrappings.
Theorem 5 (Multiplication Complexity). Suppose that k ≤ ℓ · 2ℓ . The number of
bootstrappings needed for multiplication is ≤ 3u − 2.
Proof. Recall that the Mult operation heavily relies on the Reduce operation. Hence, it
suffices to check the size of the underlying message of
                                                 i
                                                 X
                                        Mi =           Mult(ctj , ct′i−j ).
                                                 j=0

As each ctj and ct′j decrypts to a ℓ-bit unsigned integer, we have that each coordinate of
the decryption of Mi is less than or equal to

                    (2ℓ − 1) · (2ℓ − 1) · u = (d − 1)2 · u ≤ (d − 1)2 · d < d3 − d2 .

Hence, by Theorem 4, the number of bootstrappings needed is at most 3d − 2.
Theorem 6 (Shift Complexity). The number of bootstrappings needed for the right/left
shift operation is ≤ u − x.
Proof. We first prove the left shift operation. Observe that we need to compute IntModd (cti <<
y) for 0 ≤ i < u − x and Carryd (cti << y) for 0 ≤ i < u − x − 1. We can compute
IntModd (cti << y) for 0 ≤ i < u − x using u − x discrete bootstrappings. The remaining
Carryd ’s can be computed without introducing additional discrete bootstrappings. Hence
u − x in total.
   The right shift operation works exactly the same except that the IntModd is needed for
index x ≤ i < u and Carryd is needed for index x + 1 ≤ i < u.
      We summarize the analyses in Table 3.

    Next, we discuss some optimization techniques that can further reduce the computa-
tional complexity. The first optimization is to reduce the number of discrete bootstrapping
by lazily bootstrapping Carryd . For instance, one may bootstrap for every γ (instead of
1) Carryd when evaluating Reduce as in Theorem 4. Although it reduces the number of
bootstrapping by a factor γ, it increases the modulus consumption by a factor γ, so one
should carefully examine the efficiency to find a sweet spot.

Theorem 7 (Lazy Bootstrap). Let ct = (ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ctu−1 ) ∈ (R2Q )u be a vector of
ciphertexts encrypting integer vectors in [0, dm − dm−1 ], where Q ≫ dγm . Then there is an
instantiation of Reduce that uses at most m · ⌊(u − 1)/γ⌋ + u bootstrappings and dm+γ−1
of modulus.

Proof. We may instantiate exactly as in the proof of Theorem 4, except that we lazily
bootstrap for Carryd . To be explicit, we first obtain ct′′i (via Carryd operation with lazy
bootstrapping) sequentially and compute ct′i at the end (via u discrete bootstrappings).
Here we may choose the ciphertext modulus of ct′′i to be a factor d smaller than that of
ct′′i−1 for γ ∤ i and bootstrap at γ | i. As a result, the ciphertext modulus for ct′′i becomes
Q/d[i]γ . Recall that the modulus consumption for the last bootstrapping (i.e. the iterative
bootstrapping in [KN25]) is dm and the number of bootstrapping is m. Hence the total
modulus consumption is dm · dγ−1 = dm+γ−1 , and the total number of bootstrapping is

m · (# of bootstrap for Carryd ) + u · (# of bootstrap for IntModd ) = m · ⌊(u − 1)/γ⌋ + u.



   Another observation is that we may reduce lazily, especially in addition/subtraction.
For instance, if we add three ciphertext vectors ct, ct′ , ct′′ ∈ (R2Q )u , we may define the
addition of them as

                     Add(ct, ct′ , ct′′ ) = Reduce((cti + ct′i + ct′′i )0≤i<u )

hence saving one Reduce operation. We formalize this observation in the following theorem.

Theorem 8 (Lazy Addition). Let ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ctv−1 ∈ (R2Q )u be vectors of ciphertexts
encrypting unsigned k-bit integer vectors according to the encryption scheme in Section 3.1,
where v ≤ d. The addition of ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ctv−1 can be instantiated as
                                                             
                                                 v−1
                                                 X j
                                Reduce             cti       
                                               j=0
                                                         0≤i<u

with ≤ 2u − 1 discrete bootstrappings.
                                                                   Pv−1
Proof. By Theorem 4, we only need to check that for each i, j=0 ctji decrypts to an
integer vector whose entries are in [0, d2 − d]. To check this, we use the fact that ctji
decrypts to an integer vector whose entries are in [0, d − 1]. Then, by summing up at most
d such ciphertexts, we get the desired property.

   Thus, we may lazily reduce after adding ≤ d ciphertext vectors.


3.4    Implications
We discuss some direct applications of our method, namely fixed-point arithmetic and
arbitrary function evaluation over unsigned integers.

3.4.1     Fixed Point Arithmetic
As our scheme supports both multiplication and shift operations, it immediately supports
fixed-point multiplication, which can be written as a combination of multiplication of
two m bit integers and right shift by m. However, we may do much better than this
because the fixed-point multiplication can be regarded as computing the high part of the
multiplication.

     • Extended Reduction: Let ct = (ct0 , ct1 , . . . , ct2u−1 ) ∈ (R2Q )2u be a vector of
       discrete CKKS ciphertexts encrypting vectors in ZN/2 . The (extended) modular
       reduction of ct is sequentially defined as

                                  ExtReduce(ct) = (ct′0 , ct′1 , . . . , ct′2u−1 )

        where ct′0 = IntModd (ct0 ), ct′′0 = Carryd (ct0 ), and

                        ct′i = IntModd (ct′′i−1 + cti ),     ct′′i = Carryd (ct′′i−1 + cti )

        for each 1 ≤ i < 2u. The result of Reduce encrypts a message

                                           i=0

        modulo t2 , i.e., reducing the ciphertext ct to the correct base-d representation.

     • Extended Multiplication: Let ct = (cti )0≤i<u , ct′ = (ct′i )0≤i<u ∈ (R2Q )u be
       vectors of ciphertexts each encrypting a k-bit unsigned integer according to the
       encryption scheme in Section 3.1. The extended multiplication of ct and ct′ is defined
       as
                                                                                  
                                               min(i,u−1)
                                                  X
            ExtMult(ct, ct′ ) = ExtReduce                Mult(ctj , ct′i−j )      
                                                     j=max(0,i−u+1)
                                                                                               0≤i<2u

        where Mult on the right-hand side refers to the usual CKKS multiplication. The
        output vector contains the element-wise product of two input integer vectors, without
        modular reduction by t.

One may simply take the last u entries of the result of the extended multiplication to
instantiate a k-bit precision fixed-point multiplication. Recall that CKKS often struggles to
satisfy the security notions like IND-CPAD [LM21] or Threshold FHE [AJL+ 12, BGG+ 18]
as they cannot separate noise from the message. Although our fixed-point arithmetic is
much slower than the usual CKKS operations (as it involves bootstrapping), we may avoid
huge flooding which greatly increases the parameters.

3.4.2     Arbitrary Function Evaluation
As our encoding stores a large integer after decomposing it into small pieces, we may directly
benefit from the multi-precision arbitrary function evaluation in [AKP25, Section 5.3].
Since we maintain the digit-decomposed format, we do not need to perform digit extraction
in [AKP25]. We restate (and slightly modify) the arbitrary function evaluation framework
as follows.
    Let f : Zt → C be an arbitrary function, φ : Zt → Zud be the digit decomposition, and
ψ : Zd → Ud = {1, ω, . . . , ω d−1 } be defined as x 7→ ω 2πix where ω is a complex dth root of
unity. Let p ∈ C[x0 , . . . , xu−1 ] be a multivariate polynomial that interpolates the function

f ◦ φ−1 ◦ ψ −1 : Udu → C. Then the homomorphic evaluation of p instantiates f (starting
from complex roots of unity). We denote such an operation as MLUTf . We illustrate the
algorithm in Algorithm 4.
    It is worth mentioning that such functionality cannot be supported if one handles large
integers directly inside CKKS. One reason is that univariate interpolation consumes much
more multiplicative depths than multivariate interpolation, and another reason is that
large precision polynomial interpolation is numerically unstable.


4     Experiments
We provide proof-of-concept implementations for the algorithms described in the previous
section. We developed our code upon the lattigo library [lat24]. The experiments are run
single-threaded on Apple M4 Max with 128GB of RAM running macOS Sequoia 15.5. All
of our FHE parameters satisfy ≈ 128 bit security according to [BTH22].

4.1    Description
We start with providing a parameter set used for our experiments, in Table 4. Here N
denotes the RLWE ring dimension, log QP denotes the maximum RLWE modulus for
switching keys, (h, h̃) denotes the Hamming weights of the dense and sparse secrets [BTH22],
and dnum denotes the gadget rank for the switching keys. The lower table describes the
moduli chain, where log qi denotes the ciphertext modulus and log pj denotes the auxiliary
modulus for key switching. Base, StC, Mult, LUT, EvalExp, and CtS denote the moduli
reserved for the corresponding operations in the discrete bootstrapping framework [BKSS24].
When denoted as X × Y , it refers to using Y many X-bit (NTT) moduli.

                       Table 4: Parameter set for the experiments.

    Next, we elaborate on the scheme parameters of our experiments. We targeted 64-bit
operations, decomposing it into 4-bit pieces, resulting in a total of 16 pieces. In other
words, k = 64, ℓ = 4, and u = 16. Note that k ≤ 2ℓ · ℓ, which satisfies the condition for
Theorem 5. For the homomorphic modular reduction instantiation, we followed [KN25],
which relies on the discrete bootstrapping from [BKSS24]. In particular, we used the
cleaning interpolation (via Hermite interpolation) so that our bootstrapping achieves both
modulus raising and cleaning.

    We implemented addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison, and right shift
operations relying on the algorithms in Section 3.2. In particular, we used the strategy to
bootstrap every time we compute Carryd , which was mainly used in the correctness proofs.
This corresponds to the equality case in Table 3.
    The experimental results are illustrated in Table 5. Here the error is measured by
subtracting the decrypted result from the desired result. The precision denotes mean
and minimum precision, which are computed as − log2 of the mean and maximum error,
respectively. We observe that the total running time is roughly proportional to the number
of bootstrappings, as expected.

in Section 3.2 except shifting.

    To check the cost of left and right shift operations, we checked if it is linear in x = ⌊m/d⌋
as expected. We fixed y = 1 for the right shift and y = 2 for the left shift, and plotted
the graph in Figure 2. Not only the linearity but also the fact that the cost of shift is
independent of y was observed.

4.2      Comparison with Prior Works
We mainly compare our algorithm with [Zam22] as it supports all the operations we
discussed in Section 3.2. We ran their benchmark9 in the same environment as our
experiments (e.g. same machine, single-thread, etc.). The figures are illustrated in
Table 6. Our algorithm outperforms [Zam22] by 2-3 orders of magnitude, depending on
the operations, in terms of throughput. Notably, our homomorphic 64-bit multiplication is

more than 2800 times faster. To compare latency, our multiplication becomes favorable as
soon as we have ≥ 6 parallelism.

    Next, we dive deeper into homomorphic multiplications and see how the target modulus
t = 2k affects the performance. We compare our multiplication with [Zam22] for k =
4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and check both latency and throughput. The figures can be seen in Table 7.
Since our method is asymptotically almost linear in k but [Zam22] is not, the performance
difference is widened for large k. Although we experimented k ≤ 64 (due to the constraint
k ≤ ℓ · 2ℓ ), our method can be easily extended by increasing ℓ. We expect that our method
should perform even better for larger k.11

     We move on to other possible approaches based on SIMD schemes. Note that most
works do not cover multiplication, comparison, and bootstrapping at the same time. For
instance, [ZYZ+ 24] achieves good performance for both homomorphic multiplication and
comparison, but the encoding formats for the two operations are different and do not have
efficient conversions from one to another. In this regard, we focus on decomposition-based
works that seem to naturally support all three operations we are interested in.
     For arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication), we compare with [HZY+ 22], the
state-of-the-art method for radix-2 homomorphic addition/multiplication. We borrowed the
figures from [HZY+ 22, Table V and VIII], which uses a similar environment for experiments.
As illustrated in Table 8, our addition is 4−8 times faster for computing 32/64-bit additions,
and our multiplication is 240 times faster for evaluating 32-bit multiplication.
     For homomorphic comparison, we compare with [TLW+ 21], which introduces the
vector of field elements (VFE) encoding to efficiently evaluate large precision comparison.
Although their latency is much better than ours, we outperform in terms of throughput
due to the large parallelism of CKKS. The details are illustrated in Table 9.
  10 For right/left shift, we considered the smallest x which gives the largest running time for our method.
  11When ℓ > 4, one may need to choose a larger N than Table 4. Roughly, this leads to 2 to 4 times larger

bootstrapping latency. The noise can be controlled similarly. See [BKSS24] for details about scalability, as
we directly rely on their discrete bootstrapping. As mentioned earlier, the number of bootstrappings for
each homomorphic operation scales linearly with k, given a fixed ℓ.
  12 Borrowed from [TLW+ 21, Table 1]. Excluded Step (c) from the total time. Note that [IZ21] provides

a more efficient solution (≈ 2x faster), but they did not measure timings for modulo 264 .

    One could also consider comparing our homomorphic comparison with the usual CKKS
comparison [CKK20, LLKN22]. In [LLKN22, Table 7], they show ≈ 30 seconds for 20 bit
precision homomorphic comparison, but do not show higher precision implementations.
Asymptotically, the approximation based methods achieve O(α) computational complexity
for a precision parameter α [CKK20, Table 2]. For α = 64 bit precision, their performance
can be roughly estimated as 30 × (64/20) = 96 seconds. Note that the asymptotic
complexity only counts the number of homomorphic operations. For increased α, one
needs to choose a higher scaling factor ∆, leading to higher modulus q and higher ring
degree N , significantly increasing the running time.13 In addition, their methods are not
directly compatible with our approach, as our encoding stores 64 bit integers in many
low-precision discrete CKKS ciphertexts.

Memory. The public evaluation keys used in our method is exactly the same as the
bootstrapping keys for the base discrete bootstrapping [BKSS24]. For instance, each
evaluation key of the parameter set in Table 4 is of size 77 MiB, and there can be (roughly)
8 to 50 of them depending on the bootstrapping optimizations [HS18], leading to 0.6 to 4
gigabytes. The ciphertext size depends on the plaintext modulus t = 2k , in the sense that
there are k/ℓ CKKS ciphertexts per each large precision ciphertext. Concretely, a single
k = 64 bit ciphertext (with ℓ = 4) at the highest level 4 is 2 MiB × (k/ℓ) = 32 MiB, and it
becomes 64 MiB when k = 128.
    When compared to methods based on BGV-like schemes, both the evaluation key and
ciphertext sizes are similar. For example, for 32 bit multiplication, [HZY+ 22, Table 8]
used 0.680 to 28.0 GB of memory. On the other hand, CGGI/DM based approaches
(e.g. [Zam22]) use far less memory. Their functional/programmable bootstrapping often
needs bootstrapping key size of less than a hundred megabytes [LMSS23, Table 6], which
is an order of magnitude smaller than (discrete) CKKS.


4.3     Homomorphic EdDSA Signing
In [BK25], their main application is homomorphic signing, which provides one-round
threshold/blind signatures for signature schemes like EdDSA [BDL+ 12]. They propose
  13 To estimate the impact, one can roughly choose 64/20 = 3.2 times larger log (∆), leading to 3.2 times
                                                                                2
larger log2 (q) and N , and the runtime roughly becomes 3.22 × 96 = 983 seconds.

a dedicated homomorphic encryption scheme that supports homomorphic modular mul-
tiplication by an arbitrary prescribed modulus. For EdDSA, a popular choice is using a
curve 25519, which relies on arithmetic operations modulo p = 2255 − 19. We observe that
for such a Solinas prime, our homomorphic integer computer can give better performance
in terms of throughput. We instantiated the homomorphic modular multiplication using
256 bit extended multiplication, addition, and comparison. Our experimental result shows
a factor of ≈ 18 better throughput compared to [BK25], as illustrated in Table 11. Our
approach can be preferable when there are sufficiently many signings in parallel.14

5    Conclusion
In this work, we constructed a homomorphic encryption scheme that supports a wide range
of standard unsigned integer computations, such as addition, multiplication, comparison,
and bit shift. The biggest strength of our method is throughput, which shows several
orders of magnitude better performance than that of TFHE-rs.
    We view our framework as a good baseline for SIMD homomorphic computations in
general. The existing SIMD FHE schemes primarily support only addition and multiplica-
tion, often requiring dedicated approaches for general computations. On the other hand,
the CGGI/DM family has built a rich community on top of the functional/programmable
bootstrapping paradigm. We believe that our work helps emulate their success in the
corresponding SIMD FHE world.

reduction. Our method is more compatible with applying other operations afterwards.
